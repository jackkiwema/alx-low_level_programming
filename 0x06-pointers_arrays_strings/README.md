> # Tasks

#### [0. strcat](./0-strcat.c)
* Write a function that concatenates two strings. This function appends the `src` string to the `dest` string, overwriting the termination null byte `(\0) at the end of `dest`, and then adds a terminating null byte. 

#### [1. strncat](./1-strncat.c)
* Write a function that concatenates two strings. This function will use at most `n` bytes from the `src` and does not need to be null-terminated if it contains `n` or more bytes, return a pointer to the resulting string `dest`.

#### [2. strncpy](./2-strncpy.c)
* Write a function that copies a string

#### [3. strcmp](./3-strcmp.c)
* Write a function that compares two strings 

#### [4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy](./4-rev_array.c)
* Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers

#### [5. Always look up](./5-string_toupper.c)
* Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

#### [6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes](./6-cap_string.c)
* Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string. 

#### [7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody](./7-leet.c)
* Write a function that encodes a string into 1337

#### [8. rot13](./100-rot13.c)
* Write a function that encodes a string using `rot13`

#### [9. Numbers have life, they're not just symbols on paper](./101-print_number.c)
* Write a function that prints an integer

#### [10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic;it takes sweat, determination and hard work](./102-magic.c)
* Add one to [this code](./102-magic.c) to print `a[2] = 98` followed by a new line. 

#### [11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art](./103-infinite_add.c)
* Write a function that adds two numbers

#### [12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls](./104-print_buffer.c)
* Write a function that prints a buffer
